# 🚀 Quick Test Guide - Hybrid Selector Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Agent A couldn't click/type on Linear because `data-bid` attributes weren't injected (CSP blocked it).

**Solution**: Implemented 13 fallback selector strategies using Playwright's smart selectors (getByRole, getByLabel, etc.).

## 🧪 Test It Now!

### Test 1: Create Issue on Linear

```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

**What to expect:**
1. ✅ Browser opens with saved login
2. ✅ Navigates to Linear
3. ✅ Clicks "Create new issue" button (using role selector)
4. ✅ Modal opens
5. ✅ Types into title field (using contenteditable + keyboard)
6. ✅ Clicks "Create issue" button
7. ✅ Issue is created!

**Watch the logs for:**
```
Executing action: CLICK 13
✓ Clicked element with bid=13
```

### Test 2: Create Project on Linear

Update `main.py` line 50:
```python
question = "Create a new project and call this project as 'new project'"
url = "https://linear.app/softlight-assesment/team/SOF/active"
```

Run:
```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

**What to expect:**
1. ✅ Clicks "Projects" in sidebar
2. ✅ Opens project creation dialog
3. ✅ Types "new project" into title
4. ✅ Creates the project

### Test 3: Verify Selector Fallbacks

Check the logs for debug messages showing which selector worked:

```bash
# Good indicators:
2025-10-31 ... [debug] Clicked by role+name: button
2025-10-31 ... [debug] Typed by role: textbox
2025-10-31 ... [debug] Clicked by aria-label

# Bad indicators (if you see many of these, something's wrong):
2025-10-31 ... [warning] All click strategies failed for bid=X
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### ✅ Working Correctly:
- Actions complete in 3-8 seconds (fast!)
- See "Clicked by role+name" or similar in logs
- Screenshots show progression through workflow
- Task completes successfully

### ❌ Still Having Issues:
- Timeouts after 30+ seconds
- "All strategies failed" warnings
- Same screenshot repeated multiple times
- Task stops at first action

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still timing out

**Check 1**: Is data-bid injection failing?
```
Look for: "Could not inject serializer IDs (site has strict CSP)"
This is EXPECTED and NORMAL on Linear!
```

**Check 2**: Is element_map being passed?
```python
# In orchestrator.py line 73, should be:
serialized_dom, updated_html, element_map = serialize_dom(html)

# NOT:
serialized_dom, updated_html = serialize_dom(html)  # Old way
```

**Check 3**: Are fallback selectors being tried?
```
Look for debug logs like:
"data-bid failed: ..."
"role+name failed: ..."
"Clicked by aria-label"  ← This means fallback worked!
```

### Issue: Can't type into contenteditable

**Check**: Is contenteditable strategy being used?
```python
# Should see in logs:
"Typed into contenteditable by keyboard"
```

If not, check `element_map` has:
```python
element_map[bid]["contenteditable"] = True
```

### Issue: Modal elements not clickable

**Check**: Agent B instructions should reference elements INSIDE modal
```
Good: "Click the issue title field in the modal (bid=42)"
Bad: "Click the Projects link in sidebar (bid=3)"  ← Behind modal!
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Timings:

| Action | Old System | New System |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Click with data-bid | 1-2s | 1-2s ✅ |
| Click without data-bid | 30s timeout ❌ | 5-8s ✅ |
| Type into input | 1-2s | 1-2s ✅ |
| Type into contenteditable | Failed ❌ | 5-8s ✅ |

### Full Task Completion:

| Task | Old System | New System |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Create issue (Linear) | Failed ❌ | 30-45s ✅ |
| Create project (Linear) | Failed ❌ | 40-60s ✅ |
| Search (Google) | 15-20s | 15-20s ✅ |

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run single task
python softlight/main.py

# Run with CLI
python -m softlight.cli run "Create a new issue" \
  --url "https://linear.app/softlight-assesment/team/SOF/active" \
  --app Linear \
  --use-profile

# Run batch tasks
python -m softlight.cli batch \
  --tasks examples/task_questions.json \
  --use-profile

# View datasets
ls -la datasets/
open datasets/*/step_*.png  # View screenshots
```

## 📝 Quick Checks

Before reporting issues, verify:

1. ✅ Chrome profile is being used (see "Using saved login session")
2. ✅ CSP warning appears (means injection failed as expected)
3. ✅ Debug logs show fallback attempts
4. ✅ Actions complete within 5-10 seconds
5. ✅ Screenshots show progression
6. ✅ No linter errors in modified files

## 🎉 If Everything Works

You should see:
- ✅ Fast action execution (5-10s per action)
- ✅ Tasks completing successfully
- ✅ Screenshots capturing each step
- ✅ Clean logs with debug info
- ✅ Datasets organized in folders

**You're ready to demo!** 🚀

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Test on Linear** - Create issue and project
2. **Test on Google** - Verify fast path still works
3. **Review logs** - Confirm fallback strategies are working
4. **Check datasets** - Screenshots should show progression
5. **Demo time!** - Show off the robust multi-agent system
