WHAT HAPPENED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This task demonstrates the system's ability to navigate through multi-step 
workflows. The system located an existing issue by name, opened it, and 
added it to a specific project using DOM-based navigation.

The system successfully:
1. Found and clicked on "Test Issue 1" from the issues list
2. Clicked the project assignment button
3. Selected "Bot Project" from the dropdown

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 0: INITIAL STATE
- Screenshot: step_0_initial.png
- Agent B analyzed the Linear issues dashboard
- Scanned page text to locate "Test Issue 1"
- Extracted DOM elements including clickable issue cards

Step 1: CLICK to open issue
- Action: CLICK on element with bid="44"
- Reasoning: "Open 'Test Issue 1'"
- Method: DOM selector (data-bid="44")
- Screenshot: step_1_click_bid44.png
- Result: Issue detail page opened for "Test Issue 1"

Step 2: CLICK to assign project
- Action: CLICK on element with bid="26"
- Reasoning: "Add issue to project"
- Method: DOM selector (data-bid="26")
- Screenshot: step_2_click_bid26.png
- Result: Project selection dropdown appeared

Step 3: CLICK to select project
- Action: CLICK on element with bid="41"
- Reasoning: "Select 'Bot Project' from the project list"
- Method: DOM selector (data-bid="41")
- Screenshot: step_3_click_bid41.png
- Result: Issue assigned to "Bot Project"

Step 4: TASK COMPLETE
- Reasoning: "Task finished successfully"
- "Test Issue 1" is now part of "Bot Project"

HOW HYBRID MODE WORKED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Text Search: Agent B used page text to find "Test Issue 1"
✅ Context Understanding: Understood "bot project" refers to a project name
✅ Multi-Step Navigation: Handled dropdown interaction automatically
✅ Fast Execution: ~27 seconds for complete task

Agent B (GPT-4o) received:
- DOM elements with text content and attributes
- Full page text (used to locate issue by name)
- Screenshots showing visual layout

Agent A executed actions:
- All interactions used stable data-bid selectors
- No coordinate fallback needed
- Each action verified before proceeding
