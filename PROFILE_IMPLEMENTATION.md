# ‚úÖ Separate Chrome Profile Implementation - Complete

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Script would hang when trying to use your main Chrome profile because Chrome was still running.

**Solution Implemented**: Use a separate Chrome profile specifically for automation at `~/.chrome-automation-profile`.

## üîë Key Benefits

1. **No More Hanging** - Script launches immediately, even with Chrome open
2. **Persistent Login** - Log in once to Linear (or any site), stay logged in forever
3. **Clean Separation** - Automation doesn't touch your personal Chrome data
4. **Easy Reset** - Delete `~/.chrome-automation-profile` to start fresh
5. **Concurrent Use** - Browse normally while automation runs

## üìù What Changed

### 1. `browser_controller.py`
```python
# NEW: Uses separate profile directory
user_data_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.chrome-automation-profile")

# Creates directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(user_data_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Detects first-time setup
is_first_time = not os.path.exists(os.path.join(user_data_dir, "Default"))

# Launches with separate profile
self.browser = self.playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
    user_data_dir=user_data_dir,
    headless=False,
    args=["--start-maximized"],
    channel="chrome"
)
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-creates profile directory
- ‚úÖ Detects first-time vs. returning user
- ‚úÖ Helpful logging for both scenarios
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback if profile fails

### 2. `main.py`
```python
# Updated messaging
print("‚ÑπÔ∏è  Using separate Chrome profile for automation")
print("   Your main Chrome browser can stay open!")
print("   First run: You'll need to log into Linear manually")
print("   Future runs: Login will be remembered\n")
```

**Changed**:
- ‚ùå Removed: "Close Chrome before running"
- ‚úÖ Added: "Chrome can stay open"
- ‚úÖ Added: First-time vs. future run guidance

### 3. `cli.py`
Updated both `run` and `batch` commands with new messaging about the separate profile approach.

### 4. `README.md`
Added new section explaining:
- How the separate profile works
- First-time setup steps
- Future usage (automatic login)
- Link to detailed Linear setup guide

### 5. `SETUP_LINEAR.md` (New File)
Comprehensive guide including:
- Step-by-step first-time setup
- Configuration examples
- Multiple task examples
- CLI usage examples
- Troubleshooting section
- Reset instructions

## üöÄ How to Use Now

### First Time:
```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

1. Chrome opens (separate window from your regular Chrome)
2. Navigate to Linear
3. **Manually log in**
4. Script continues automatically

### Every Other Time:
```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

That's it! You're automatically logged in. üéâ

## üìÇ Profile Storage

**Location**: `~/.chrome-automation-profile/`

**What's Stored**:
- Cookies (including login sessions)
- Local storage
- Cache
- Browser preferences

**What's NOT Stored**:
- Your personal bookmarks
- Your browsing history
- Your Chrome extensions (from main profile)

## üîß Profile Management

### View profile contents:
```bash
ls -la ~/.chrome-automation-profile
```

### Check profile size:
```bash
du -sh ~/.chrome-automation-profile
```

### Reset profile (start fresh):
```bash
rm -rf ~/.chrome-automation-profile
```

Next run will be treated as first-time setup.

### Backup profile:
```bash
cp -r ~/.chrome-automation-profile ~/.chrome-automation-profile.backup
```

## üéØ Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **First run** (will prompt for login):
```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

2. **Second run** (should auto-login):
```bash
python softlight/main.py
```

3. **Verify persistence**:
```bash
# Check if profile was created
ls ~/.chrome-automation-profile/Default/

# Should see files like Cookies, Preferences, etc.
```

## üîç Technical Details

### Launch Mode
Uses `launch_persistent_context()` instead of `launch()` + `new_context()`.

**Why?**
- Persistent context maintains state between runs
- Profile directory preserves cookies and storage
- More reliable than trying to save/restore cookies manually

### Headless Mode
Must use `headless=False` when using persistent profiles.

**Why?**
- Persistent contexts don't support headless mode
- User needs to see browser for first-time login anyway
- Minimal overhead since automation is relatively quick

### Channel Selection
Uses `channel="chrome"` to launch actual Google Chrome.

**Why?**
- Better compatibility with modern web apps
- Same rendering as regular browsing
- Supports latest web features

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profile directory permission error
```bash
chmod -R 755 ~/.chrome-automation-profile
```

### Issue: "Channel 'chrome' not found"
Install Google Chrome (not Chromium), or change to:
```python
channel="chromium"  # in browser_controller.py
```

### Issue: Login doesn't persist
Check if profile files were created:
```bash
ls ~/.chrome-automation-profile/Default/Cookies
```

If missing, profile write failed - check disk space.

### Issue: Want to use different profile location
Update `browser_controller.py` line 20:
```python
user_data_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/your/custom/path")
```

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Multiple Profiles** - Support profiles per workspace
2. **Profile Cleanup** - Auto-clean old cache/logs
3. **Session Export** - Export cookies for other tools
4. **Profile Encryption** - Encrypt stored credentials
5. **Profile Switching** - CLI flag to select profile

## üìä Implementation Stats
